  Descrpition: This file contains most of the code for the Subtractive 
  Synthesiser Audio Application. The Subtractive Synthesiser Audio
  Application takes in white noise and band-passes corresponding
  to what midi notes are received. The GUI contains a qValue slider, 
  which controls the purity of the tone, and a volume slider. 
  Additionally, there is a MidiKeyboardComponent, from which the 
  application receives its midi information.
